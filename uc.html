                                <p>I started making music from way back in JSS1 creating melodies in my head and playing
                                    them in my head. This habit was gotten from my mum cus she used to make songs for us as
                                    kids and I picked up from there and started making songs for people and stuff I was
                                    going through and some of these melodies are what I use in the songs I make today.
                                    Started doing music professionally when I was like 14 tho my brothers friend helped me
                                    record a song then I had more confidence in myself as time went on and continued
                                    creating and everytime I thought I was the bomb I always kept on surpassing that level
                                    of artistry and getting even better and till today im still on that plain of
                                    improvement.</p><br>
                                <p>I'm doing music because it feels right to do it. It's not passive, it's purposeful.
                                    There's intent in every single thing I do and that is spiritual. God is the inspiration,
                                    he's the director i'm just following the script.</p><br>
                                <p>Faces is a love song mehn as simple as that. The song was supposed to be for my girl at
                                    the time I wrote it in 2022 but we broke up but the song was too good to just let go

                                <p>Hi, I'm Ekene Emmanuel, also known as Keith. I was born on the 20th of October 2004 in
                                    the city of Jos, located in Plateau State, Nigeria. Currently, I'm a university student,
                                    constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.</p><br>
                                <p>Beyond my academic commitments, I transform into a dynamic individual with a passion for
                                    web development. I also find joy in capturing moments as a perceptive photographer and
                                    crafting compelling narratives through videography.</p><br>
                                <p>I break conventional boundaries, refusing to settle for ordinary snapshots. Every
                                    photograph I take transcends the present, weaving together elements that inspire the
                                    future. My creative impulse draws inspiration from a myriad of sources, turning the
                                    ordinary into extraordinary. Armed with nothing but my trusty smartphone, I immerse
                                    myself in my craft, infusing each shot with a unique perspective. In my hands, every
                                    image emerges as a pristine reflection of my creative vision, encapsulating moments that
                                    resonate deeply with those who view them.</p><br>
                                <p>Your passion and dedication shine through in your words! Keep creating and capturing
                                    those extraordinary moments.</p><br>

                    <p>I started making music from way back in JSS1 creating melodies in my head and playing them in my
                        head. This habit was gotten from my mum cus she used to make songs for us as kids and I picked
                        up from there and started making songs for people and stuff I was going through and some of
                        these melodies are what I use in the songs I make today. Started doing music professionally when
                        I was like 14 tho my brothers friend helped me record a song then I had more confidence in
                        myself as time went on and continued creating and everytime I thought I was the bomb I always
                        kept on surpassing that level of artistry and getting even better and till today im still on
                        that plain of improvement.</p><br>
                    <p>I'm doing music because it feels right to do it. It's not passive, it's purposeful. There's
                        intent in every single thing I do and that is spiritual. God is the inspiration, he's the
                        director i'm just following the script.</p><br>
                    <p>Faces is a love song mehn as simple as that. The song was supposed to be for my girl at the time
                        I wrote it in 2022 but we broke up but the song was too good to just let go lmaoo</p><br>
